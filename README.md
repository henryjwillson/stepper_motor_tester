# stepper_motor_tester
Small unit and software to quickly test performance of stepper motors. Small unit allows connection of a power source, to arduino nano microcontroller and a stepper motor driver to connect to a stepper motor and test it's performance. This small portable unit allows stepper motors fixed in situ to be tested seperately to the main operation hardware they are normally attatched to. This allows step diagnosis of issues and calibration of stepper motors. 

The design includes the ability to run multiple programs, switch to change motor step direction and a switch to change between two different stepper motor drivers (A4988 and DRV8825). Bananna Plug Style Connections allows easy connections to power leads from a variable power supply unit to change voltage and current supplied to Stepper Motor whilst retaining a constant voltage and current to the arduino micro controller.
